Steam-Card-Wallpaper-Downloader
===============================

This python script downloads all the steam card wallpapers via http://www.steam.cards/

Requirements
===============================

[BeautifulSoup4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - To parse the html

Updates:
===============================

This script will continue to be updated with any requests people have.
At the moment, my todo looks like:
* Add downloading of background images (currently the script only downloads the HD card images, not the background images as well)
