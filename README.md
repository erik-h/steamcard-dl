steamcard-dl
===============================

A python script which downloads all the steam card wallpapers and backgrounds via http://www.steam.cards/

Requirements
===============================

[BeautifulSoup4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - To parse the html

**NOTE:** I have only run this with Python 2.7.6 . It should work with other versions, but again I haven't tested it out.

Usage
===
```sh
python steamcard-dl.py
```

Updates
===============================

This script will continue to be updated with any requests people have.
At the moment, my todo looks like (crossed out items are past tasks that are now completed):
* ~~Add downloading of background images (currently the script only downloads the HD card images, not the background images as well)~~
